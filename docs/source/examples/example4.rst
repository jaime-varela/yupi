Example 4
=========

Tracking an intruder while penetrating a granular 
material in a quasi 2D enviroment. Code and multimedia resources are 
available `here <https://github.com/yupidevs/yupi_examples/>`_.

The work carried out in [1] studied 
penetration of an intruder inside a granular material, 
focusing in the influence of a wall for the trajectory 
of the intruder. The authors tested different configurations 
and observed specific phenomenons during the penetration 
process (i.e. repulsion and rotation), enabling the 
quantification of those phenomenons and its dependence 
with the initial distance of the intruder from the wall.

In this example, we provide a script that extracts the 
trajectory of the intruder from one of the videos used 
to produce the results of the original paper. Moreover, 
we include details to generate a plot that looks like the 
one presented in the paper.

The example is structured as follows:
 #. Setup dependencies
 #. Tracking tracking objects
 #. Computation of the variables
 #. Results
 #. References



1. Setup dependencies
---------------------

Import all the dependencies:

.. code-block:: python

   from yupi.tracking.trackers import ROI, ObjectTracker, TrackingScenario
   from yupi.tracking.undistorters import RemapUndistorter
   from yupi.tracking.algorithms import ColorMatching
   from yupi.analyzing.visualization import plot_trajectories
   from numpy import pi

Set up the path to multimedia resources:

.. code-block:: python

   video_path = 'resources/videos/Diaz2020.MP4'
   camera_file = 'resources/cameras/gph3+.npz'


2. Tracking tracking objects
----------------------------

First, we create an instance of an undistorter to correct the distortion 
caused by the camera lens.

.. code-block:: python

   undistorter = RemapUndistorter(camera_file)

The variable camera\_file contains the path to a .npz file with the 
matrix of calibration for the specific camera configuration, more details 
on how to produce it can be found `in here 
<https://yupi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/tracking/undistorters.html>`_.

Then, we initialize two trackers, one for each marker of the intruder:

.. code-block:: python

   algorithm1 = ColorMatching((70,40,20), (160,80,20)) # BGR
   cyan = ObjectTracker('cyan marker', algorithm1, ROI((50, 50)))

   algorithm2 = ColorMatching((30,20, 50), (95, 45,120))         
   magenta = ObjectTracker('magenta marker', algorithm2,  ROI((30, 50)))


And this time, we will create the TrackingScenario with the trackers and 
also the Undistorter.

.. code-block:: python

   scenario = TrackingScenario([cyan, magenta], 
                            undistorter=undistorter)

Then, we track the video using the configured scenario. We should notice 
that we will have to initialize the Region-of-Interest (ROI) of each tracker 
manually. See the API reference for different initialization methods of ROIs.

.. code-block:: python

   retval, tl = scenario.track(video_path, pix_per_m=2826, start_frame=200)
   plot_trajectories(tl)

.. figure:: /images/example4-1.png
   :alt: Output of example4
   :align: center

3. Computation of the variables
-------------------------------

We can improve the visualization, by making some transformation to the tracked
trajectories. First, we can rotate them 90 degrees to better illustrate the 
effect of gravity:

.. code-block:: python

   tl[0].rotate(- pi / 2)
   tl[1].rotate(- pi / 2)


Next, we update the system of reference to place it in the initial position of
the center of the intruder:

.. code-block:: python

   off = tl[0].r[0]
   tl[1] -= off
   tl[0] -= off



4. Results
----------
Now, we can produce a plot quite similar to the one of the original paper [1]:

.. code-block:: python

   plot_trajectories(tl, line_style='-o', connected=True, color=['blue', 'red'])


.. figure:: /images/example4-2.png
   :alt: Output of example42
   :align: center
