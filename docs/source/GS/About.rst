Yupi is a set of tools designed for collecting, generating and processing trajectory data. It is written in Python, on top of state-of-the-art libraries for image and data processing, such as opencv, numpy and matplotlib. The focus of this tool is to bring a complete framework for handling trajectory data: covering artificial generation of trajectories using stochastic models, estimation of the motion of objects inside image sequences and statistical analysis of trajectories through different methods. As written in `a wise software documentation <https://keras.io/about/>`_: Being able to go from idea to result as fast as possible is key to doing good research.
